## Abstract
Tracking macros is the key to achieving fitness goals. Optimizing high protein intake while minimizing calories with a balance of macros is critical to proper dieting and nutrition. This project aims to build a solution that maximizes protein intake while minimizing the cost, balancing the macros relative to basic fitness objectives (bulking, cutting or maintaining) and providing some variety using tertiary constraints.
